> **Protect Your Children** is an AI + IoT prototype that detects children near dangerous zones (e.g., windows, balconies) or holding sharp objects.  
> It triggers **alerts/actuators** via Arduino to prevent accidents.

## 🔎 Overview
This project combines **Computer Vision (YOLOv8)** with **IoT (Arduino)** to:
- Detect children near windows/balconies.
- Detect sharp objects (e.g., knife, scissors).
- Trigger Arduino **servo + buzzer** to close the window or raise an alarm.
- Provide an **easy-to-use GUI (Streamlit)** for image-based testing.

⚠️ **Note:** This is for educational and prototyping purposes only. It is not a certified safety device.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time detection with **YOLOv8**.  
- Simple web GUI built with **Streamlit** (no camera required).  
- Upload an image → get detection results instantly.  
- Bounding boxes drawn on the image.  
- Object list with confidence scores.

## 🖼 GUI
A lightweight GUI built with **Streamlit**:  

- Upload an image (JPG/PNG).  
- The AI model processes it with YOLOv8.  
- The system returns the annotated image + detected objects.  

Example interface:
